# AccessibilityRefactoring

## Description

- I created this webpage because I wanted a proof of concept style project that adequately demonstrated my skill with refactoring pre-existing code while also demonstrating I understand the process of pushing that refactored code live using GitHub. 
- This webpage displays the services recieved by clients of the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
- While working on this project I learned how to create repositories from scratch. I also learned how to properly use classes, ID's and image source tags while incorporating them into both CSS and HTML files.
